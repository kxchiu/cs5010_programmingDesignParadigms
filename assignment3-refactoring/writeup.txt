1. I added an extra class to store variable names (stored as protected static final) to be accessed in the email sender. A couple benefits to this: First, this prevents the use of magic numbers/local variables, which are replaced with represented with more understandable and meaningful variable names. Second, this allows such that the variables can be accessed across elsewhere in the system/program when needed or when we want to expand on the features in the future.
2. In the Main class, I added an extra method to check on the args for sending email and email recepient, which is seperated from the check args for generating the message from the templates. I did so because generating the message files and sending emails are very different functionality, and they should be independent of one another when doing a check on the input args.
